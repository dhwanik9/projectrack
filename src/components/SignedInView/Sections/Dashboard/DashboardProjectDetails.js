        Projectrack is a web application for final year students that helps them in tracking their project.
        Using this application students can define their teams, breakdown their projects in smaller tasks,
        and those tasks are assigned to each team member. Additionally, team members can upload
        documents in PDF format, related to project, such as DFDs, Flowcharts, etc.
